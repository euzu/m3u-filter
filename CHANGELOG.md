# Changelog
# 2.2.6 (2025-04-xx)
- !BREAKING CHANGE!  bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  is now `throttle` and supports units. Allowed units are `KB/s`,`MB/s`,`KiB/s`,`MiB/s`,`kbps`,`mbps`,`Mibps`.
Default unit is `kbps`.
- `grace_period_millis` default set to 0 milliseconds.
- Added rate limiting per IP. The burst_size defines the initial number of available connections, 
 while period_millis specifies the interval at which one connection is replenished.
If behind a proxy `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip` or `forwarded` should be set as header. 
The configuration below allows up to 10 connections initially and then replenishes 1 connection every 500 milliseconds.
```yaml
reverse_proxy:
  rate_limit:
    enabled: true
    period_millis: 500
    burst_size: 10
```
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `web_ui config` restructured and added `user_ui_enabled` attribute
```yaml
web_ui:
  enabled: true
  user_ui_enabled: true
  path:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    issuer: m3u_filter
    secret: ef9ab256a8c0abe5de92c2e05ca92baa810472ab702ff1674e9248308ceeec92
    userfile: user.txt
```
- user has now the attribute `ui_enabled` to disable/enable web_ui for user.
- epg processing optimization, auto guessing/assigning epg id's

# 2.2.5 (2025-03-27)
- fixed web ui playlist regexp search
- added `web_ui_path` to `config.yml`
- added grace period `grace_period_millis`  attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  If you have a provider or a user where the max_connection attribute is greater than 0,
  a grace period can be given during the switchover.
  If this period is set too short, it may result in access being denied in some cases.
  The default is 1000 milliseconds (1sec).
- added bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`

- fixed `hdhomerun` and `strm` config check for non-existing username. 
- "Breaking CHANGE! Moved `connect_timeout_secs` is global timeout and defiend in config root and not `reverse_proxy.stream`. 

# 2.2.3 (2025-03-23)
- variable resolving for config files now for all settings
- hls reverse proxy implemented
- dash redirect implemented (reverse proxy not supported) 
- !BREAKING CHANGE! `channel_unavailable_file` is now under `custom_stream_response`,
- New custom streams `user_connections_exhausted` and `provider_connections_exhausted`added. 
```yaml
custom_stream_response:
  channel_unavailable: /home/m3u-filter/resources/channel_unavailable.ts
  user_connections_exhausted: /home/m3u-filter/resources/user_connections_exhausted.ts
  provider_connections_exhausted: /home/m3u-filter/resources/provider_connections_exhausted.ts
```
- input alias definition for same provider with same content but different credentials
```yaml
- sources:
- inputs:
  - type: xtream
    name: my_provider
    url: 'http://provider.net'
    username: xyz
    password: secret1
    aliases:
    - name: my_provider_2 
      url: 'http://provider.net'
      username: abcd
      password: secret2
  targets:
  - name: test
```
Input aliases can be defined as batches in csv files with `;` separator.
There are 2 batch input types  `xtream_batch` and `m3u_batch`.
`XtreamBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
- inputs:
  - type: xtream_batch
    url: 'file:///home/m3u-filter/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
  targets:
  - name: test
```

```csv
#name;username;password;url;max_connections;priority
my_provider_1;user1;password1;http://my_provider_1.com:80;1;0
my_provider_2;user2;password2;http://my_provider_2.com:8080;1;0
```

`M3uBatch`:
```yaml
- sources:
- inputs:
  - type: m3u_batch
    url: 'file:///home/m3u-filter/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
  targets:
  - name: test
```

```csv
#url;max_connections;priority
http://my_provider_1.com:80/get_php?username=user1&password=password1;1;0
http://my_provider_2.com:8080/get_php?username=user2&password=password2;1;0
```
The Fields `max_connections` and `priority`are optional.
`max_connections`  will be set default to `1`. This is different from yaml config where the default is `0=unlimited`  

- added two options to reverse proxy config `forced_retry_interval_secs` and `connect_timeout_secs`
`forced_retry_interval_secs` forces every x seconds a reconnect to the provider,
`connect_timeout_secs` tries only x seconds for connection, if not successfully starts a retry. 

# 2.2.2 (2025-03-12)

target `options`:
- `ignore_logo`: `true`|`false`,
- `share_live_streams`: `true`|`false`,
- `remove_duplicates`: `true`|`false`,

target output type `hdhomerun`:
- `device`: _mandatory_,
- `username`: _mandatory_,
- `use_output`: _optional_, `m3u`|`xtream`

Example:
```yaml
targets:
  - name: xc_m3u
    output:
      - type: xtream
        skip_live_direct_source: true,
        skip_video_direct_source: true,
      - type: m3u
      - type: strm
        directory: /tmp/kodi

- The Web UI now includes a login feature for playlist users, allowing them to set their groups for filtering and managing their own bouquet of groups.
 The playlist user can login with his credentials and can select the desired groups for his playlist.
- Added `user_config_dir` to `config.yml`. It is the storage path for user configurations (f.e. bouquets).
- New Filter field `input` can be used along `name`, `group`, `title`, `url` and `type`. Input is a `regexp` filter. `input ~ "provider\-\d+"`
- New option `use_user_db` in `api-proxy.yml`. The Playlist Users are stored inside the config file `api-proxy.yml`. When you set this option to `true`
the user are stored in a db file. This is a better choice if you have a lot of users. If you have only a few let it default to `false`

  `strm` files now o get timestamp from `addedd`property if exists.
- shared live stream implementation refactored.
- added optional user properties: `max_connections`, `status`, `exp_date` (expiration date as unix seconds). 
If they exist they are checked when `config.yml` `user_access_control` set to true., if you don't need them remove this fields from `api-proxy.yml` 
Added option in `config.yml` the option `user_access_control` to activate the checks. Default is false.  
- Added option `channel_unavailable_file` in `config.yml`. If a provider stream is not available this file content is send instead.

- Implemented workaround for missing tvg-ID

# 2.0.4(2024-09-19)

        value: '(?i)(?P<quality>HD|LQ|4K|UHD)?'
    mapper:
      - tvg_name: TF1 $quality
        # https://regex101.com/r/UV233E/1
        tvg_names:
          - '^\s*(FR)?[: |]?TF1!delimiter!!quality!\s*$'
        tvg_id: TF1.fr
        tvg_chno: "1"
